# DEMO
https://dambasement.github.io/vintage-tv/

# Features
- Vintage TV is a theme created to reproduce the effect of an old TV with the effect of a typical terminal and background music created especially for you.
- The page can be used as a reference landing page on social media or as a small presentation page.
- It uses of [Typewriter](https://safi.me.uk/typewriterjs/), a simple yet powerful native javascript plugin for a cool typewriter effect.
- Mp3 track crafted for this site. It sounds quite retro, just give it a try. ðŸŽ¹
- Fully responsive on smartphones, tablets and laptops
